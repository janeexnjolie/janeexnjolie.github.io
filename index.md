## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1-

    I enjoyed lab 1 because we were just getting started in the class. This lab was easy and informative by creating our github accounts and setting us up for the rest of the semester. It is where we learned how to use the git commands and push to github.

* Lab 7-

    I enjoyed lab 7 because I just thought it was fun. I liked that we had to read the street signs and actually put our brains to use by figuring out when parking was allowed and then putting it in code. I also had a really nice partner during this lab who I got to know well and was very helpful.

* Lab 8-

    One of my favorite things to do was to declare a variable and then initialize it. I just thought it was easy and cool to see how just declaring a variable allows lots of data to be put into just one or two words.
